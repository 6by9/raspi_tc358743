Raspi_tc358743: An example app that controls a Toshiba TC358743 HDMI
to CSI-2 bridge chip, and receives the incoming data over CSI-2 on
a Raspberry Pi.

Originally from https://github.com/6by9/userland/tree/hdmi_in_hack/host_applications/linux/apps/raspicam
but separated out into a new repo for ease of maintance and speed
of building.
Please see the old repo for a more complete history, but thanks
to orbitinstatis and christienmiller for their input there.
